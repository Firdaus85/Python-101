The “Montreal Experiments” refers to Donald Ewan Cameron’s methods of depatterning and repatterning the brain and by definition according to Dr. Cameron

“Depatterning” refers to Cameron’s methods of erasing a patient’s thoughts whereby patients were immobilized, rendered intellectually helpless and prevented from using their usual defenses through the use of intensive Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT)1, sensory isolation, massive amounts of sedatives and barbiturates to lessen patients’ resistance and to induce sleep treatment. It was a three-stage

“Psychic driving” refers to the “repatterning” procedure whereby patients were subjected to a continuously repeated audio message on a looped tape, often concurrently with muscular paralytic and sedating drugs to subdue them for purposes of exposure to the looped message(s) such as Thorazine and Amobarbital2.

The sensory deprivation involved depriving patients of their senses by covering their ears, eyes, and/or skin, depriving them of food, water, and oxygen and instead injecting them with drugs such as Lysergic Acid Diethyamide (LSD)3 and curare4 to keep them in a disoriented and paralyzed state;

The drug-induced sleep involved administering patients with large amounts of sedatives (such as chlorpromazine, marketed under the trade-names Thorazine and Largactyl) in order to put them into an artificial coma

All in ALL : (i) drug-induced sleep/coma, (ii) intensive electroconvulsive therapy (“ECT”), (iii) “psychic driving”, (iv) sensory deprivation, and (v) administration of various barbiturates, chemical agents and medications to suppress nerve functionality and activation;


D.	Resolutions
1.	Subject or patient must give informed consent
2.	There must be a concrete scientific basis for the experiment.
3.	Experiment should yield positive results that cannot be obtained any other way
4.	Interest of patient must always prevail over the interest of science /society
