# Welcome!

Python is a  programming language popular for its simplicity and the ability to create complex applications and here is my journey to learning Python from A-Z.


# Objective
The goal of this project is to cover the basic concepts and fundamentals of python programming language with emphasis on variables, numbers, functions, booleans and conditionals, list, loops, and list comprehension, working with external libraries, strings, and dictionaries.


# Self note
I know that to get good at anything I have to practice every day, If I break the problem down into small exercises and lessons and do them every day, I can learn to do almost anything. And If I focus on slowly improving and enjoying the learning process, then I will benefit.
